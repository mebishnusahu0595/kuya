## 🎯 Next Steps to Publish on PyPI

### Step 1: Create PyPI Accounts

#### Test PyPI (for testing first - RECOMMENDED)
```bash
# Go to: https://test.pypi.org/account/register/
# Create an account and verify your email
```

#### Production PyPI
```bash
# Go to: https://pypi.org/account/register/
# Create an account and verify your email
```

### Step 2: Upload to Test PyPI (Try it first!)

```bash
cd /home/bishnups/Documents/PROJECT-COLLEGE
source venv/bin/activate

# Upload to Test PyPI
twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
```

You'll be prompted for:
- **Username**: `__token__`
- **Password**: Your Test PyPI API token (get it from https://test.pypi.org/manage/account/token/)

### Step 3: Test Installation from Test PyPI

```bash
# Create a fresh virtual environment
python3 -m venv test_env
source test_env/bin/activate

# Install from Test PyPI
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple kuya-data

# Test it works
python -c "import kuya; print(kuya.__version__)"
```

### Step 4: Upload to Production PyPI 🎉

If testing went well:

```bash
cd /home/bishnups/Documents/PROJECT-COLLEGE
source venv/bin/activate

# Upload to production PyPI
twine upload dist/*
```

You'll be prompted for:
- **Username**: `__token__`
- **Password**: Your PyPI API token (get it from https://pypi.org/manage/account/token/)

### Step 5: Verify Live Installation

```bash
# Anyone in the world can now install your package!
pip install kuya-data

# Use it
python -c "import kuya; df = kuya.quick_clean('data.csv'); print(df.summary())"
```

## 🔒 Setting Up API Tokens (Recommended)

### For Test PyPI:
1. Go to https://test.pypi.org/manage/account/token/
2. Click "Add API token"
3. Name it "kuya-upload"
4. Set scope to "Entire account" or specific to "kuya-data"
5. Copy the token (starts with `pypi-`)
6. Save it securely!

### For Production PyPI:
1. Go to https://pypi.org/manage/account/token/
2. Click "Add API token"
3. Name it "kuya-upload"
4. Set scope to "Entire account" or specific to "kuya-data"
5. Copy the token (starts with `pypi-`)
6. Save it securely!

### Save tokens in `~/.pypirc`:

```bash
cat > ~/.pypirc << 'EOF'
[distutils]
index-servers =
    pypi
    testpypi

[pypi]
username = __token__
password = pypi-YOUR_PRODUCTION_TOKEN_HERE

[testpypi]
repository = https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
username = __token__
password = pypi-YOUR_TEST_TOKEN_HERE
EOF

chmod 600 ~/.pypirc
```

Then uploading becomes simpler:
```bash
twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*  # No password prompt!
twine upload dist/*                         # No password prompt!
```

1. **Update version** in `setup.py` and `pyproject.toml`
2. **Document changes** in a CHANGELOG.md
3. **Rebuild packages**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf dist/ build/ *.egg-info

   twine upload dist/*
   ```

Version numbering (follow semantic versioning):
- **0.1.0** → **0.1.1**: Bug fixes
- **0.1.0** → **0.2.0**: New features (backward compatible)
- **0.1.0** → **1.0.0**: Major release (might break compatibility)

## 🎯 Quick Command Reference

```bash
# Activate environment
cd /home/bishnups/Documents/PROJECT-COLLEGE
source venv/bin/activate

# Build packages
python -m build

# Upload to Test PyPI

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Package name already taken"
- Use `kuya-data` instead of `kuya` (already configured)
- Or try: `kuya-ai`, `kuya-plus`, `kuyapy`

### "Invalid credentials"
- Make sure username is `__token__` (not your username)
- Get a fresh API token from PyPI settings
- Check you're using the right token (test vs production)

### "File already exists"
- You can't overwrite existing versions on PyPI
- Bump version number and rebuild
- Or use `--skip-existing` flag

### "README rendering error"
- Check README.md renders correctly
- Test with: `twine check dist/*`
- Fix any markdown issues
