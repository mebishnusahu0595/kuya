## 🚀 THREE WAYS TO UPLOAD

### Option 1: Use the Interactive Script (EASIEST) 🎯

```bash
cd /home/bishnups/Documents/PROJECT-COLLEGE
./upload_to_pypi.sh
```

This script provides a menu to:
1. Upload to Test PyPI (recommended first)
2. Upload to Production PyPI
3. Check packages
4. Clean and rebuild
5. Exit

### Option 2: Manual Upload (RECOMMENDED)

#### Step 1: Upload to Test PyPI first

```bash
cd /home/bishnups/Documents/PROJECT-COLLEGE
source venv/bin/activate
twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
```

You'll need:
- Username: `__token__`
- Password: Your Test PyPI API token from https://test.pypi.org/manage/account/token/

#### Step 2: Test Installation

```bash
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple kuya-data
```

#### Step 3: Upload to Production PyPI

```bash
twine upload dist/*
```

You'll need:
- Username: `__token__`
- Password: Your PyPI API token from https://pypi.org/manage/account/token/

### Option 3: Quick Upload (if you're confident)

```bash
cd /home/bishnups/Documents/PROJECT-COLLEGE && source venv/bin/activate && twine upload dist/*
```

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### "The user '__token__' isn't allowed to upload to project 'kuya'"
→ The name `kuya` might be taken. Your package is configured as `kuya-data` (backup name)

### "HTTP Error 403: Invalid or non-existent authentication information"
→ Check you're using `__token__` as username (not your PyPI username)
→ Make sure you copied the full token (including `pypi-` prefix)

### "File already exists"
→ Can't re-upload same version. Bump version number and rebuild

### "README rendering error"  
→ Run `twine check dist/*` to validate (already passed ✅)
