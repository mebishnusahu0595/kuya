# • One-hot for 3-5 categories
# • Label encoding for 6+ categories
# All based on AI logic! 🧠
```

### 5. 📊 Multiple Normalization Methods
```python
# Choose your scaling method
df_minmax = df.normalize(method='minmax')    # 0-1 scaling
df_zscore = df.normalize(method='zscore')    # Standardization
df_robust = df.normalize(method='robust')    # Outlier-resistant
```

### 6. 📝 Auto-Generated Reports
```python
# Professional reports in seconds
ky.auto_report(df, output_path='analysis', format='html')
ky.auto_report(df, output_path='analysis', format='txt')

# Get:
# 📄 Executive summaries
# 📊 Statistical analysis
# 📈 Visualizations
# 💡 Key insights
# All formatted beautifully!
```

### 7. 💡 Automated Insights Discovery
```python
# Let AI discover patterns
insights = df.auto_insights()

# Finds:
# 📈 Skewed distributions
# 🔗 Hidden correlations  
# 🎯 Dominant values
# ⚠️  Unusual patterns
# 🔍 Unique identifiers
```
